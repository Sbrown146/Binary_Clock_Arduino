# Binary_Clock_Arduino
Arduino Uno Binary Clock Circuit -> Demo Vid coming soon along with prototype model.

A Binary Clock using an Arduino Uno and over 50 LEDS to display the time, date and day of week!

This project was initially used as a means to introduce myself to the basics of C++ and its differences with Javascript but grew into a near finished prototype to display the time using LEDS in binary.  This circuit includes the following components:

1 Arduino Uno (or MC with at least 15 pin outs)
9 74HC595 ICs
1 DS3231 I2C RTC Module Clock Timer
1 LCD 1602 Module
1 PWM for LED Brightness Control
66 LEDS
67 1000Ω Resistors
1 2200Ω Resistor
2 Switches
7 Buttons
